## üîß Technical Specifications

### AirTable Forms Conditional Logic

**For arrival_method field:**
```
Show when: goods_location = 'Arrived'
Required: Yes
Field Type: Single Select
Options:
  - Sea Freight (Port)
  - Air Freight
  - Courier
  - Other Location
```

**For arrival_timeline field:**
```
Show when: goods_location IN ('1-2 Days', '1 Week', 'More Than Week')
Required: Yes
Field Type: Single Select
Options:
  - Within 1 Week (Urgent)
  - 1-4 Weeks (Standard)
  - Over 1 Month (Plenty of Time)
```

**Note:** AirTable Forms use display names, but underlying values should match form field values for data consistency.

---

## üéØ Answers to Your Original Questions

### Q1: "Do we still capture destination port in the form?"

**Answer:** YES, but the field is called `arrival_method` (not `destination_port`)
- When goods_location = 'arrived', the form shows arrival_method field
- Option `sea_port` = "üö¢ Sea freight (Port)" captures port arrival
- This field effectively serves as "destination port" identifier

### Q2: "Why is it present in fields within implementation guide?"

**Answer:** It WASN'T present - that's what your question helped uncover!
- destination_port doesn't exist (0 occurrences in form or guide)
- But arrival_method DOES exist in form and was missing from V4.0 guide
- V4.1 now includes complete arrival_method documentation
- Plus discovered arrival_timeline was also missing

---

## üìà Benefits of V4.1 Update

1. **Complete Data Capture**
   - Won't lose port/airport location data
   - Won't lose in-transit timing expectations
   - All form fields now documented

2. **Implementation Accuracy**
   - Field mapping table ensures correct AirTable setup
   - No guesswork on field names or types
   - Conditional logic clearly specified

3. **Visual Alignment**
   - Mermaid flowcharts match actual form
   - Implementer can see exact form flow
   - Easy to spot conditional branches

4. **Future-Proof**
   - arrival_timeline captured for future urgency enhancement
   - Documentation ready for business logic evolution
   - Clear notes on what's used vs what's captured

5. **Single Source of Truth**
   - One table aligns Form, AirTable, Mermaid
   - Reduces implementation errors
   - Makes maintenance easier

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### 1. goods_location Values
**Important:** In AirTable Forms, use display-friendly names, but ensure underlying values match:
- Form value: `arrived` = Display: "Arrived"
- Form value: `1_2_days` = Display: "1-2 Days" or "Arriving within 48 hours"
- Form value: `1_week` = Display: "1 Week" or "Arriving within one week"
- etc.

**Why:** Scoring and routing formulas reference exact values (`arrived`, `1_2_days`, etc.)

### 2. Conditional Fields Hierarchy
The form shows fields in this conditional order:
1. `goods_location` (always shown for imports)
2. **IF** arrived ‚Üí `arrival_method`
3. **IF** in-transit ‚Üí `arrival_timeline`
4. **IF** not_shipped_yet ‚Üí `shipping_payment`

Make sure AirTable Forms conditional logic follows this exact sequence.

### 3. arrival_timeline Scoring
Currently **NOT used** in urgency_score formula. Document notes this is available for future enhancement. If business wants to use it, formula is provided in Section 4 "Future Formula Enhancement (Optional)".

### 4. Educational Pathway Priority
Routing formula checks educational pathway FIRST:
```javascript
IF(AND({goods_location} = "not_shipped_yet", {shipment_method} = "not_sure"), "education", ...
```
This must remain Priority #1 check or educational users will route incorrectly.

## üìû Support & Questions

If you discover any discrepancies during implementation:
1. Check Field Mapping Table (Section 2) first
2. Verify field names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Check conditional logic in Section 5
4. Review Mermaid flowchart for visual confirmation

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist Before Implementation

- [ ] I understand `arrived` = "in port/airport already" (arrived_nz)
- [ ] I understand in-transit = `1_2_days` / `1_week` / `more_than_week`
- [ ] I understand `not_shipped_yet` is distinct planning state
- [ ] I've reviewed the Field Mapping Table (Section 2)
- [ ] I understand arrival_method captures WHERE goods arrived
- [ ] I understand arrival_timeline captures WHEN in-transit goods expected
- [ ] I know arrival_timeline is captured but not yet in scoring
- [ ] I have the Implementation Guide V4.1 ready
- [ ] I have the Mermaid Flowcharts V4.1 ready
- [ ] I'm ready to create the AirTable Base
