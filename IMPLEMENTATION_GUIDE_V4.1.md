# Easy Freight - Complete AirTable Implementation Guide

**Version 4.1 - Form Structure Alignment & Field Mappings**  
**Last Updated**: 23 October 2025

## üîÑ V4.1 Critical Updates

**Purpose:** This version aligns the implementation guide with the approved prototype form structure.

### Changes from V4.0:

1. ‚úÖ **ADDED:** `arrival_method` field specification (WHERE goods arrived - port/airport/courier)
2. ‚úÖ **ADDED:** `arrival_timeline` field specification (WHEN in-transit goods expected)
3. ‚úÖ **ADDED:** Complete Form ‚Üí AirTable ‚Üí Mermaid field mapping table
4. ‚úÖ **CLARIFIED:** `goods_location = 'arrived'` means "arrived_nz" (in port/airport already)
5. ‚úÖ **CLARIFIED:** In-transit state uses `goods_location` values (`1_2_days`, `1_week`, `more_than_week`)
6. ‚úÖ **CLARIFIED:** `not_shipped_yet` is a distinct planning state (educational pathway trigger)
7. ‚úÖ **UPDATED:** Urgency scoring to include `arrival_timeline` for future in-transit scoring
8. ‚úÖ **UPDATED:** All Mermaid flowcharts to reflect actual form field structure

### Previous V4.0 Updates:
- ‚úÖ CORRECTED: BIO Security pricing $67 NZD (was $50)
- ‚úÖ ADDED: Container Estimation Calculator, Print Quote, Data Download features
- ‚úÖ ADDED: Reference ID generation system
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è CLARIFIED: destination_country (EXPORT only), payment terms hints (still present)

### üîç Critical Field Clarifications

#### 1. goods_location Field Values & Meanings

| Value | Meaning | Urgency Implication | Conditional Fields Triggered |
|-------|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `arrived` | **Goods already in NZ port/airport** (arrived_nz) | HIGHEST (score=10) | Shows `arrival_method` field |
| `1_2_days` | Goods arriving within 48 hours (in-transit) | HIGH (score=8, or 9 if air) | Shows `arrival_timeline` field |
| `1_week` | Goods arriving within one week (in-transit) | MEDIUM (score=5) | Shows `arrival_timeline` field |
| `more_than_week` | Goods arriving more than a week (in-transit) | LOW (score=2) | Shows `arrival_timeline` field |
| `not_shipped_yet` | Goods not shipped yet (planning stage) | LOWEST (score=1) | Shows `shipping_payment` field, enables `shipment_method='not_sure'` (educational pathway) |

**Key Understanding:**
- `arrived` = arrived_nz = "already in New Zealand port/airport destination"
- In-transit states (`1_2_days`, `1_week`, `more_than_week`) represent goods currently in-transit
- `arrival_timeline` field appears for in-transit goods to capture future urgency expectations
- `not_shipped_yet` is distinct planning state enabling educational pathway

#### 2. arrival_method Field (NEW - V4.1)

**Purpose:** Captures WHERE goods arrived when they're already in NZ

**Conditional Display:** Only shown when `goods_location = 'arrived'`

**Options:**

| Value | Display Label | Description | AirTable Display |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| `sea_port` | üö¢ Sea freight (Port) | Auckland/Wellington/Christchurch Port | Sea Freight (Port) |
| `air_freight` | ‚úàÔ∏è Air freight | Auckland Airport | Air Freight |
| `courier` | üìÆ NZ Post/Courier | Small package delivery | Courier |
| `other` | ‚ùì Other location | Different arrival method | Other Location |

**AirTable Implementation:**
- Field Type: Single Select
- Options: Sea Freight (Port), Air Freight, Courier, Other Location
- Conditional: goods_location = 'arrived'
- Required: Yes (when visible)
- Purpose: Identifies specific arrival location/port for logistics coordination

**Mermaid Chart Reference:** `arrival_method`

#### 3. arrival_timeline Field (NEW - V4.1)

**Purpose:** Captures WHEN in-transit goods expected to arrive (future urgency planning)

**Conditional Display:** Only shown when `goods_location` is in-transit (`1_2_days`, `1_week`, or `more_than_week`)

**Options:**

| Value | Display Label | Description | Urgency Implication |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `within_week` | üö® Within 1 week | Urgent preparation needed | Future HIGH urgency |
| `1_4_weeks` | üìÖ 1-4 weeks | Standard processing timeline | Future MEDIUM urgency |
| `over_month` | üìÜ More than 1 month | Plenty of time for preparation | Future LOW urgency |

**AirTable Implementation:**
- Field Type: Single Select
- Options: Within 1 Week (Urgent), 1-4 Weeks (Standard), Over 1 Month (Plenty of Time)
- Conditional: goods_location IN ('1_2_days', '1_week', 'more_than_week')
- Required: Yes (when visible)
- Purpose: Captures expected arrival timing for goods currently in-transit
- **Future Use:** Can be incorporated into urgency scoring or email automation timing

**Mermaid Chart Reference:** `arrival_timeline`

**Note:** Currently NOT used in urgency scoring formula, but captured for future enhancement and customer service planning.

## üßÆ Scoring Logic Implementation

### Urgency Score Calculation

**Formula Field: `urgency_score`**  
**Type:** Number (0-10)  
**Purpose:** Determines priority level based on goods timing and cargo type

#### Current Implementation (Matches Approved Form)

```javascript
SWITCH({goods_location},
  "arrived", 10,
  "1_2_days", IF({shipment_method} = "air_freight", 9, 8),
  "1_week", 5,
  "more_than_week", 2,
  "not_shipped_yet", 1,
  0
) +
IF({cargo_type} = "food_beverages", 2, 0) +
IF({cargo_type} = "chemicals_dangerous", 3, 0)
```

**Maximum Score:** 10 (capped)

#### Urgency Scoring Breakdown

| Condition | Base Score | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Goods Location** |||
| `arrived` (arrived_nz - in port/airport) | 10 | HIGHEST PRIORITY - Goods waiting at port/airport |
| `1_2_days` | 8 | HIGH - Arriving within 48 hours |
| `1_2_days` + `air_freight` | 9 | URGENT - Air freight arriving soon |
| `1_week` | 5 | MEDIUM - Arriving within one week |
| `more_than_week` | 2 | LOW - More than a week away |
| `not_shipped_yet` | 1 | PLANNING - Not yet shipped |
| **Cargo Type Modifiers** |||
| `food_beverages` | +2 | Perishable items urgency |
| `chemicals_dangerous` | +3 | Safety/compliance urgency |

**Total Score Calculation:**
```
urgency_score = MIN(
  goods_location_score + cargo_type_modifier,
  10
)
```

#### arrival_timeline Field (Future Enhancement)

**Status:** Field captured in form but NOT currently used in urgency scoring

**Purpose:** Provides additional timing context for in-transit goods (goods_location = 1_2_days/1_week/more_than_week)

**Captured Values:**
- `within_week` = üö® Within 1 week (Urgent preparation needed)
- `1_4_weeks` = üìÖ 1-4 weeks (Standard processing timeline)
- `over_month` = üìÜ More than 1 month (Plenty of time)

**Future Formula Enhancement (Optional):**
```javascript
// If you want to use arrival_timeline in scoring:
SWITCH({goods_location},
  "arrived", 10,
  "1_2_days", IF({shipment_method} = "air_freight", 9, 8),
  "1_week", IF({arrival_timeline} = "within_week", 6, 5),
  "more_than_week", IF({arrival_timeline} = "within_week", 4, 2),
  "not_shipped_yet", 1,
  0
) +
IF({cargo_type} = "food_beverages", 2, 0) +
IF({cargo_type} = "chemicals_dangerous", 3, 0)
```

**Recommendation:** Keep current formula as approved unless business requires arrival_timeline urgency differentiation.

---

### Complexity Score Calculation

**Formula Field: `complexity_score`**  
**Type:** Number (0-15+)  
**Purpose:** Determines service complexity and specialist routing needs

```javascript
SWITCH({cargo_type},
  "documents_samples", 0,
  "general_goods", 1,
  "other", 1,
  "personal_effects", 2,
  "food_beverages", 4,
  "frozen_goods", 5,
  "perishable_goods", 5,
  "vehicles_machinery", 5,
  "chemicals_dangerous", 8,
  0
) +
SWITCH({shipping_payment},
  "customer_pays_exw", 4,
  "customer_pays_fob", 2,
  0
) +
IF({container_type} = "fcl", 5, 0) +
IF({requires_temperature_control} = TRUE, 3, 0)
```

#### Complexity Scoring Breakdown

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Cargo Type** |||
| Documents/Samples | 0 | Simplest |
| General Goods | 1 | Standard commercial goods |
| Other | 1 | Custom category |
| Personal Effects | 2 | Used goods valuation |
| Food/Beverages | 4 | MPI compliance |
| Frozen/Perishable/Vehicles/Machinery | 5 | Special handling |
| Chemicals/Dangerous Goods | 8 | High compliance requirements |
| **Shipping Payment Terms** |||
| EXW (Supplier door) | +4 | Full freight forwarding service |
| FOB (Origin port) | +2 | Shipping + customs |
| CIF/Not Sure | 0 | Customs clearance only |
| **Container Type** |||
| FCL (Full Container Load) | +5 | Freight forwarding required |
| LCL/Not Applicable | 0 | Standard handling |
| **Special Requirements** |||
| Temperature Control | +3 | Refrigerated containers ($67 surcharge) |

**Specialist Routing Threshold:** complexity_score ‚â• 8

---

### Readiness Score Calculation

**Formula Field: `readiness_score`**  
**Type:** Number (0-10)  
**Purpose:** Measures customer document preparedness

```javascript
IF({commercial_invoice_status} = "ready", 3, 
   IF({commercial_invoice_status} = "dont_have", 1, 0)) +
IF({packing_list_status} = "ready", 2,
   IF({packing_list_status} = "dont_have", 1, 0)) +
IF(OR(
   {air_waybill_status} = "ready", 
   {bill_of_lading_status} = "ready", 
   {courier_receipt_status} = "ready"
), 2, 0) +
IF({customs_code_status} = "have_code", 3, 1)
```

**Note:** `document_status` values are: `ready`, `pending`, `dont_have`

#### Readiness Scoring Breakdown

| Document | Ready | Don't Have | Pending/Not Applicable |
|----------|-------|------------|------------------------|
| Commercial Invoice | 3 | 1 | 0 |
| Packing List | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| Transport Document (AWB/BOL/Courier) | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| Customs Client Code | 3 | 1 | - |

**Maximum Score:** 10 (all documents ready + customs code)

**Standard Routing Threshold:** readiness_score ‚â• 6

---

### Routing Decision Logic

**Formula Field: `routing_decision`**  
**Type:** Single Select Text  
**Options:** `urgent`, `standard`, `education`, `specialist`

#### Master Routing Formula

```javascript
IF(AND({goods_location} = "not_shipped_yet", {shipment_method} = "not_sure"), "education",
IF({container_type} = "fcl", "specialist",
IF({urgency_score} >= 8, "urgent",
IF({complexity_score} >= 8, "specialist",
IF(AND({shipping_payment} = "supplier_pays_cif", {urgency_score} >= 4), "standard",
IF(AND(OR({shipping_payment} = "customer_pays_fob", {shipping_payment} = "customer_pays_exw"), {complexity_score} >= 4), "specialist",
IF(OR(AND({urgency_score} >= 4, {readiness_score} >= 6), AND({urgency_score} >= 4, {shipment_method} = "sea_freight")), "standard",
"education")))))))
```

#### Routing Priority Hierarchy (Checked in Order)

| Priority | Condition | Route To | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **1** | `goods_location = 'not_shipped_yet'` AND `shipment_method = 'not_sure'` | **EDUCATION** | First-time importer needs guidance (educational pathway) |
| **2** | `container_type = 'fcl'` | **SPECIALIST** | Full container requires freight forwarding |
| **3** | `urgency_score >= 8` | **URGENT** | Immediate action required |
| **4** | `complexity_score >= 8` | **SPECIALIST** | Hazardous/complex goods need expert handling |
| **5** | `shipping_payment = 'supplier_pays_cif'` AND `urgency_score >= 4` | **STANDARD** | Customs clearance only, moderately urgent, ready to process |
| **6** | `shipping_payment IN ('customer_pays_fob', 'customer_pays_exw')` AND `complexity_score >= 4` | **SPECIALIST** | Freight forwarding with complexity |
| **7** | (`urgency_score >= 4` AND `readiness_score >= 6`) OR (`urgency_score >= 4` AND `shipment_method = 'sea_freight'`) | **STANDARD** | Ready with documents OR standard sea freight process |
| **8** | None of above | **EDUCATION** | Default fallback - needs guidance |

#### Routing Outcomes

| Route | Meaning | Service Level | Price Tier |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **URGENT** | Immediate action needed | Priority response (same-day) | Premium |
| **STANDARD** | Ready to process | Standard response (24-48 hours) | Standard |
| **SPECIALIST** | Complex/requires forwarding | Expert consultation | Custom quote |
| **EDUCATION** | Needs guidance | Educational resources + follow-up | Educational pricing |

## üéØ Pricing Logic Implementation

### Should Show Pricing Logic

**Formula Field: `show_pricing`**

```javascript
AND(
  NOT({routing_decision} = "specialist"),
  NOT({routing_decision} = "education"),
  NOT({container_type} = "fcl"),
  OR(
    {shipping_payment} = "supplier_pays_cif",
    {routing_decision} = "urgent", 
    {routing_decision} = "standard"
  )
)
```

**Pricing is NOT shown for:**
- Educational pathway (`routing_decision = "education"`)
- Specialist cases (`routing_decision = "specialist"`)
- FCL containers (`container_type = "fcl"`)

### Base Pricing Calculation

**Formula Field: `base_service_fee`**

```javascript
197 + 
IF({customs_code_status} = "need_help", 65, 0) +
IF({requires_temperature_control}, 50, 0) +
(MAX({commercial_invoice_lines}, 5) - 5) * 5
```

**Pricing Components:**
- **Base Customs Clearance**: NZD $197
- **Customs Code Application**: +NZD $65 (if `need_help`)
- **BIO Security** (Temperature Control): +NZD $67 (if `requires_temperature_control = true`) **[CORRECTED from $67]**
- **Multiple Invoice Lines**: +NZD $5 per line over 5 lines

**Note**: Temperature control renamed to "BIO Security" in customer-facing pricing display but field name remains `requires_temperature_control`.

**Display Format Example:**
```
Base Customs Clearance Service: $197.00
BIO Security (Temperature Control): $67.00
Additional Invoice Lines: $15.00 (3 lines)
---
Subtotal: $262.00
GST (15%): $39.30
---
Total Estimate: $301.30 NZD
```

### Mobile Optimisations (December 2024)

**Dynamic Viewport Handling:**

**CSS Custom Property:**
```javascript
// Calculate accurate viewport height for mobile
function setVH() {
  let vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01;
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--vh', `${vh}px`);
}

// Update on load and resize
window.addEventListener('resize', setVH);
window.addEventListener('orientationchange', setVH);
setVH();
```

**Usage in CSS:**
```css
.container {
  height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100);
}
```

**iOS Safari Specific:**
```css
.form-container {
  height: -webkit-fill-available;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Accurate mobile rendering across all devices
- Fixes iOS Safari viewport height issues
- Handles orientation changes smoothly
- Prevents content cutoff on mobile browsers

---

**Touch Optimisation:**

**Button Sizing:**
```css
.btn {
  min-height: 44px; /* iOS accessibility guideline */
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
  .btn {
    min-height: 48px; /* Enhanced for small screens */
    width: 100%; /* Full-width on mobile */
  }
}
```

**Sticky Navigation:**
```css
.form-navigation {
  position: sticky;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 100;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0 -2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

**Keyboard Interference Protection:**
```javascript
// Detect keyboard appearance
window.visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  const isKeyboardOpen = window.visualViewport.height < window.innerHeight;
  document.body.classList.toggle('keyboard-open', isKeyboardOpen);
});
```

**Smooth Scrolling:**
```css
.form-content {
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

**Double-Tap Zoom Prevention:**
```css
button, input, select, textarea {
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Improved mobile usability
- Better accessibility compliance  
- Prevents button overlap with keyboard
- Smooth native scroll behaviour on iOS
- Professional mobile experience

### Smart Auto-Advance Prevention

**Problem Solved:**  
Form was auto-advancing to next step while users were still typing, causing frustration and data loss.

**Solution Implemented:**  
Multi-layered detection system to prevent auto-advance during any user interaction.

**Detection Methods:**

1. **Focus Detection:**
```javascript
// Prevent auto-advance when any input has focus
const isAnyInputFocused = document.activeElement.matches(
  'input, textarea, select'
);
```

2. **Typing Activity Tracking:**
```javascript
let lastKeystroke = 0;
document.addEventListener('keydown', () => {
  lastKeystroke = Date.now();
});

// 2-second protection after last keystroke
if (Date.now() - lastKeystroke < 2000) {
  return; // Don't auto-advance
}
```

3. **User Interaction Awareness:**
```javascript
let lastInteraction = 0;
['click', 'keydown', 'touchstart'].forEach(event => {
  document.addEventListener(event, () => {
    lastInteraction = Date.now();
  });
});

// 1-second protection buffer
if (Date.now() - lastInteraction < 1000) {
  return; // Don't auto-advance
}
```

4. **Event Delegation:**
```javascript
// Catch all inputs, including dynamically added ones
document.addEventListener('focus', (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches('input, textarea, select')) {
    isUserInteracting = true;
  }
}, true);
```

5. **Focus Transition Handling:**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('blur', (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches('input, textarea, select')) {
    // 50ms transition buffer
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!document.activeElement.matches('input, textarea, select')) {
        isUserInteracting = false;
      }
    }, 50);
  }
}, true);
```

**Benefits:**
- No accidental step changes while typing
- Maintains smooth UX flow
- Prevents data loss from premature advancement
- Non-disruptive implementation
- Works with all input types

**Implementation Note:**  
All safety checks combined - auto-advance only proceeds when ALL conditions indicate user is idle.

---

### Auto-Focus Enhancement

**Feature:**  
Intelligent focus system for cargo type clarification fields.

**Behaviour:**
```javascript
// When cargo type is selected
selectCargoType(type) {
  this.formData.cargo_type = type;
  
  // Focus on clarification field if exists
  setTimeout(() => {
    const clarificationField = document.querySelector(
      `#${type}_clarification`
    );
    if (clarificationField) {
      clarificationField.focus();
      clarificationField.scrollIntoView({ 
        behavior: 'smooth', 
        block: 'center' 
      });
    }
  }, 100);
}
```

**Visual Highlighting:**
- Clarification fields highlighted with coloured left border
- Uniform background: `#f8f9fa`
- No gradient backgrounds (removed for consistency)
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Cargo Types with Auto-Focus:**
- General goods ‚Üí `cargo_details` (optional text input)
- Food & beverages ‚Üí `requires_temperature_control` (radio)
- Personal effects ‚Üí `personal_item_mixed` (checkbox)
- Vehicles/machinery ‚Üí `personal_item_condition` (radio)
- Chemicals/dangerous ‚Üí `msds_document_status` (file upload)
- Other ‚Üí `other_cargo_description` (required textarea)

**Benefits:**
- Faster form completion
- Clear indication of next required action
- Improved accessibility
- Better mobile experience
